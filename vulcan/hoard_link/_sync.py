"""A synchronous facade for apps whose own code is not async.

Runs a private event loop in a background thread and forwards every call
through :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. One facade per
:class:`~hoard_link.link.Link`; the loop is started lazily on first use.

The facade drives a private *twin* of the parent ``Link`` (same config,
its own probe cache and, when the parent created its own HTTP client, its
own ``httpx.AsyncClient``). An ``httpx.AsyncClient`` binds its connection
pool to the first event loop that uses it, so sharing the parent's client
between the app's loop and this private loop fails with "bound to a
different event loop" as soon as an app mixes ``await link.chat()`` and
``link.sync.chat()``. A client the app injected itself is shared as given
(the app owns its lifecycle; a transport-level mock has no loop state).

It is safe to call from a thread that is running its own event loop (the
call blocks that thread until the result is ready — prefer ``await`` there)
and it refuses, instead of deadlocking, to be called from its own loop
thread (e.g. from inside an ``on_progress`` callback).
